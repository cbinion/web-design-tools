    <dl>
      <dt id="faq2">What is Jon Stewart's birth name?</dt>
      <dd>He was born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz. He began using the stage name Jon Stewart by dropping his last name
        and changing the spelling of his middle name, Stuart, to Stewart. He often jokes that it was because people
        had trouble pronouncing Leibowitz, or it "sounded too Hollywood" (a reference to Lenny Bruce's joke on the
        same theme). He has implied that the name change was due to a strained relationship with his father, with whom
        Stewart no longer had any contact.</dd>
