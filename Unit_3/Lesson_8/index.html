      <h3>Early Life</h3>

      <p>Jon Stewart was born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz on November 28<sup>th</sup> 1962 at Doctors Hospital in New York
        City's Upper East Side to Marian (n√©e Laskin), a teacher and later educational consultant, and Donald Leibowitz
        (1931-2013), an energy coordinator for the New Jersey Department of the Treasury. Stewart's family members are
        Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants to America from Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus. One of his grandfathers was born in
        Manzhouli (now part of China). He is the second of four sons, with older brother Lawrence, and younger brothers
        Dan and Matthew.</p>
      <p>Stewart and his brother Lawrence, who was previously the chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext (parent
        company of the New York Stock Exchange), grew up in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, where they attended Lawrence High
        School.</p>
      <p>Stewart graduated in 1984 from The College of William & Mary where he initially majored in chemistry before
        switching to psychology.</p>

      <h3>Career</h3>
      <p>With a reputation for being a funny man in school, Stewart returned to New York City in 1986 to try his hand at
        the comedy club circuit, but could not muster the courage to get on stage until the following year. He made his
        stand-up debut at The Bitter End, where one of his comedic idols, Woody Allen, also began. He began using the
        stage name Jon Stewart by dropping his last name and changing the spelling of his middle name, Stuart, to
        Stewart.</p>
      <p>In 1989, he landed his first television job as a writer for Caroline's Comedy Hour. In 1990, he began
        co-hosting Comedy Central's Short Attention Span Theater with Patty Rosborough. In 1992, he hosted the
        short-lived You Wrote It, You Watch It on MTV, which invited viewers to send in their stories to be acted out by
        the comedy troupe, The State.</p>
      <p>Later in 1993, Stewart developed The Jon Stewart Show, a talk show on MTV, which was later dropped by the
        network and was syndicated for its last two years. The Jon Stewart Show was the first talk show on that network
        and was an instant hit, becoming the second-highest rated MTV show, behind Beavis and Butt-Head.After being
        moved to a 2 A.M. time slot, ratings were dismal and the show was canceled in June 1995.</p>
      <p>In 1998, when Craig Kilborn left the show to replace Tom Snyder on The Late Late Show, Stewart began hosting
        The Daily Show on Comedy Central. The Daily Show blends humor with the day's top news stories, usually in
        politics, while simultaneously poking fun at politicians, newsmakers, and the news media. He would serve as the
        host until 2015.</p>

      <h3>Personal Life</h3>

      <p>While making the 1997 film, Wishful Thinking, a production assistant on the film arranged for a blind date
        between Stewart and Tracey Lynn McShane. They dated for four years. Stewart proposed to her through a
        personalized crossword puzzle created with the help of Will Shortz, the crossword editor at The New York Times.
        They married in 2000.</p>
      <p>With the help of in vitro fertilization, the couple has two children. In 2015, he adopted a vegetarian diet for
        ethical reasons; his wife is a long-time vegan. Later, he became vegan as well.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Stewart and his wife bought a 12-acre (4.9 ha) farm in Middletown, New Jersey, called "Bufflehead
        Farm". The Stewarts operate it as a sanctuary for abused animals. Four years later, they received approval to
        open a 45-acre (18 ha) animal sanctuary in Colts Neck, New Jersey, a home to animals saved from slaughterhouses
        and live markets.</p>
