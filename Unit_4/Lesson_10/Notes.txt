I need to include some more information about myself. Like:

"Think about this when you're writing your About Us page content. What story would I tell the world about me? If you
were going to use this site as part of a professional portfolio, how would you showcase your skills to a prospective
employer? You would likely want to tell them of all the technology and ideas you learned to implement to tell stories to
the world. Think of all the experiences and developments you had while building this window to the world.

Make sure you include pictures of people, locations and other relevant images that could elicit a positive response and
increase engagement. Don't skimp on the design elements, either. This page is about us and should reflect our best
image. Use the skills you've developed in this class to get creative and show off those skills.

To get you thinking, here is a link to Hub Spot, a popular marketing site, that guides site owners to tell their stories
and get people excited to engage and come back for more. It is specifically about writing effective About Us pages.

Possibly include this CV element I wrote before but deleted:
